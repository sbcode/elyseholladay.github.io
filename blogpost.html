            NASA is not about the 'Adventure of Human Space Exploration'&hellip;We won't be doing it just to get out there in space&mdash;we'll be doing it because the things we learn out there will be making life better for a lot of people who won't be able to go.

            For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.

            The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly! The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind.

            Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center&mdash;an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.
